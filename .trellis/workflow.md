# Development Workflow

---

## Core Principles

1. **Plan before code** — figure out what to do before you start
2. **Specs injected, not remembered** — guidelines are injected via hook/skill, not recalled from memory
3. **Persist authorized task evidence** — record confirmed research, decisions and lessons in their existing artifact locations; explicit stateless Grill and read-only consultation retain their boundaries
4. **Incremental development** — one task at a time
5. **Capture learnings** — review task evidence and promote durable, confirmed knowledge to existing specs within authorization

---

## Trellis System

### Developer Identity

On first use, initialize your identity:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/init_developer.py <your-name>
```

Creates `.trellis/.developer` (gitignored) + `.trellis/workspace/<your-name>/`.

### Spec System

`.trellis/spec/` holds coding guidelines organized by package and layer.

- `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` — entry point with **Pre-Development Checklist** + **Quality Check**. Actual guidelines live in the `.md` files it points to.
- `.trellis/spec/guides/index.md` — cross-package thinking guides.

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages   # list packages / layers
```

**When to update spec**: new pattern/convention found · bug-fix prevention to codify · new technical decision.

### Task System

Every task has its own directory under `.trellis/tasks/{MM-DD-name}/` holding `task.json`, `prd.md`, optional `design.md`, optional `implement.md`, optional `research/`, and context manifests (`implement.jsonl`, `check.jsonl`) for sub-agent-capable platforms.

```bash
# Task lifecycle
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<title>" [--slug <name>] [--parent <dir>]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <name>          # set active task (session-scoped when available)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source      # show active task and source
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py finish                # clear active task (triggers after_finish hooks)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py archive <name> --no-commit  # archive without implicit Git actions
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list [--mine] [--status <s>]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-archive

# Code-spec context (injected into implement/check agents via JSONL).
# `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` are seeded on `task create` for sub-agent-capable
# platforms; the AI curates real spec + research entries during planning when needed.
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context <name> <action> <file> <reason>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-context <name> [action]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py validate <name>

# Task metadata
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-branch <name> <branch>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-base-branch <name> <branch>    # PR target
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-scope <name> <scope>

# Hierarchy (parent/child)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>

# PR creation
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create-pr [name] [--dry-run]
```

> Run `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py --help` to see the authoritative, up-to-date list.

**Current-task mechanism**: `task.py create` creates the task directory and (when session identity is available) auto-sets the per-session active-task pointer so the planning breadcrumb fires immediately. `task.py start` writes the same pointer (idempotent if already set) and flips `task.json.status` from `planning` to `in_progress`. State is stored under `.trellis/.runtime/sessions/`. If no context key is available from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or a platform-native session environment variable, there is no active task and `task.py start` fails with a session identity hint. `task.py finish` deletes the current session file (status unchanged). `task.py archive <task>` writes `status=completed`, moves the directory to `archive/`, and deletes any runtime session files that still point at the archived task.

### Workspace System

Records every AI session for cross-session tracking under `.trellis/workspace/<developer>/`.

- `journal-N.md` — session log. **Max 2000 lines per file**; a new `journal-(N+1).md` is auto-created when exceeded.
- `index.md` — personal index (total sessions, last active).

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/add_session.py --title "Title" --commit "hash" --summary "Summary" --no-commit
```

### Context Script

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py                            # full session runtime
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages            # available packages + spec layers
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <X.Y>  # detailed guide for a workflow step
```

<!--
  WORKFLOW-STATE BREADCRUMB CONTRACT (read this before editing the tag blocks below)

  The [workflow-state:STATUS] blocks embedded in the ## Phase Index section
  below are the SINGLE source of truth for the per-turn `<workflow-state>`
  breadcrumb that every supported AI platform's UserPromptSubmit hook
  reads. inject-workflow-state.py (Python platforms) and
  inject-workflow-state.js (OpenCode plugin) only parse them — there is no
  fallback dict baked into the scripts after v0.5.0-rc.0.

  STATUS charset: [A-Za-z0-9_-]+. When the hook can't find a tag, it
  degrades to a generic "Refer to workflow.md for current step." line —
  intentionally visible so users notice and fix a broken workflow.md.

  INVARIANT (test/regression.test.ts):
    Every workflow-walkthrough step marked `[required · once]` must have a
    matching enforcement line in its phase's [workflow-state:*] block. The
    breadcrumb is the only per-turn channel; if a mandatory step isn't
    mentioned there, the AI silently skips it (Phase 1 planning gate
    skip and Phase 3.4 commit skip both manifested via this gap).

  TAG ↔ PHASE scoping:
    [workflow-state:no_task]      → no active task; before Phase 1
    [workflow-state:planning]     → all of Phase 1 (status='planning')
    [workflow-state:planning-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 1
    [workflow-state:in_progress]  → Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4
                                    (status stays 'in_progress' from
                                    task.py start until task.py archive)
    [workflow-state:in_progress-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 2/3
    [workflow-state:completed]    → currently DEAD: cmd_archive flips
                                    status and moves the dir in the same
                                    call, so the resolver loses the
                                    pointer (block kept for a future
                                    explicit in_progress→completed
                                    transition)

  Editing checklist:
    - When you change a [workflow-state:STATUS] block, also check the
      matching phase's `[required · once]` walkthrough steps for sync
    - Run `trellis update` after editing to push the new bodies to
      downstream user projects (block-level managed replacement)
    - Full runtime contract:

## Phase Index

```
Phase 1: Plan    → classify, resolve existing authorization, then write needed planning artifacts
Phase 2: Execute → implement only after task status is in_progress
Phase 3: Finish  → verify, update spec, commit when authorized, and wrap up
```

### Request Triage

- A focused Git pull/sync request follows the existing Git authorization and preservation procedure; it does not require a new development task, interview or graph rebuild.
- Conversation or read-only consultation: do not create a task. An explicit small implementation request authorizes lightweight task recording and implementation after requirements and acceptance are clear; do not ask again for the same scope.
- Explicit complex implementation request: create a planning task and review requirements within the authorized scope. Ask before task creation only when the user requested consultation only, declined task tracking, or a scope/risk decision remains unresolved.
- Creation-only approval does not authorize implementation. Reuse explicit implementation approval when scope and decisions are already clear; ask only for unresolved or high-risk choices.

### Planning Artifacts

- `prd.md` — requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Do not put technical design or execution checklists here.
- `design.md` — technical design for complex tasks: boundaries, contracts, data flow, tradeoffs, compatibility, rollout / rollback shape.
- `implement.md` — execution plan for complex tasks: ordered checklist, validation commands, review gates, and rollback points.
- `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` — spec and research manifests for sub-agent context. They do not replace `implement.md`.
- Lightweight tasks may be PRD-only. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.

### Parent / Child Task Trees

Use a parent task when one user request contains several independently verifiable deliverables. The parent task owns the source requirement set, the task map, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review; it normally should not be the implementation target unless it also has direct work.

Use child tasks for deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently. Parent/child structure is not a dependency system: if one child must wait for another, write that ordering in the child `prd.md` / `implement.md` and keep each child's acceptance criteria testable.

Prefer the smallest independently verifiable outcome through the necessary layers, rather than separate schema/API/UI tickets. Record actual blockers and the evidence that clears them; take the next unblocked deliverable. Broad migrations may use expand, migrate, then contract with compatibility and verification boundaries. Do not create children for ordinary checklist steps or unresolved decisions.

While planning multiple children, preserve the parent session context with `task.py create "<title>" --slug <name> --parent <parent-dir> --no-start`. Default `create` activates the new child for the session even while its status remains `planning`. Keep the parent path explicit and verify children remain planning; activate an authorized child only after its planning gate. Do not use `start` merely to restore the parent's pointer, because it can advance task status. Link existing tasks with `task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>`, and unlink mistakes with `task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>`.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown when there is no active task (before Phase 1) -->

[workflow-state:no_task]
No active task. Classify the request and check existing authorization before creating a task.
Conversation/read-only: no task. Explicit small implementation request: record a lightweight task and proceed within its authorized scope.
Explicit complex implementation request: create a planning task and review requirements within the authorized scope. Ask only for unresolved scope, business, or high-risk decisions.
[/workflow-state:no_task]

### Phase 1: Plan
- 1.0 Create task `[required · once]` (after resolving task authorization under Request Triage)
- 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]` (`prd.md`; complex tasks also need `design.md` + `implement.md`)
- 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`
- 1.3 Configure context `[required · once]` — Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Reasonix (sub-agent-dispatch platforms only; inline platforms skip)
- 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]` (review gate, then `task.py start`; status → in_progress)
- 1.5 Completion criteria

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 (status='planning') -->

[workflow-state:planning]
Use the project planning route. `$grill-me` is an explicit, stateless conversation used only when the user invokes it; after shared understanding is confirmed, Trellis persists the conclusions and resumes planning. Reuse approved conclusions and do not run `trellis-brainstorm` after Grill Me.
Inspect task artifacts, specs, and code first. Automatically select task-bound `grill-with-docs` when a user decision affecting scope, key design choices, or acceptance criteria remains unresolved; reuse the current interview owner and confirmed answers. If the skill is unavailable, use native `trellis-brainstorm`. Clear requests proceed without interviewing. Follow Phase 1.1 for reopening affected choices and native gates. `to-spec` synthesizes the PRD, `to-tickets` uses native children, and `wayfinder` maps current Design decisions.
Lightweight: `prd.md` can be enough. Complex: finish `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md`; request review before `task.py start` only for outstanding decisions or an unsatisfied project gate.
Multi-deliverable scope: consider a parent task plus independently verifiable child tasks; dependencies must be written in child artifacts, not implied by tree position.
Sub-agent mode: curate `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` as spec/research manifests before start.

[/workflow-state:planning-inline]

### Phase 2: Execute
- 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress'.
     Scope: all of Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4 (status stays 'in_progress' from
     task.py start until task.py archive; only archive flips it). The body
     therefore must cover every required step from implementation through
     commit, including Phase 3.3 spec update and Phase 3.4 commit. -->

Sub-agent dispatch protocol applies to all platforms and all sub-agents, including class-2 Codex/Gemini/Qoder/Copilot/ZCode/Reasonix/Trae and `trellis-research`: every dispatch prompt starts with `Active task: <task path from task.py current>` before role-specific instructions.

[workflow-state:in_progress]
Tools: `trellis-implement` / `trellis-research` are sub-agent types only (Task/Agent tool, NOT Skill; there is no skill by these names). `trellis-update-spec` is a skill. `trellis-check` exists as both; prefer the Agent form when verifying after code changes.
Flow: `trellis-implement` -> `trellis-check` -> `trellis-update-spec` -> Git authorization check (Phase 3.4) -> `/trellis:finish-work`.
Native checks cover the actual task scope and report Spec and Standards separately; use task-selected verification. Check success does not grant Git authorization.
The adapted `implement` capability follows this execution policy; `code-review` supplies analysis inside the same native check rather than launching another review. `handoff` records canonical pointers in current task/journal locations.
Main-session default: dispatch implement/check sub-agents. Sub-agent self-exemption: if already running as `trellis-implement`, do NOT spawn another `trellis-implement` or `trellis-check`; if already running as `trellis-check`, do NOT spawn another `trellis-check` or `trellis-implement`. Dispatch is main session only.
Dispatch prompt starts with `Active task: <task path from task.py current>`. Read context: jsonl entries -> `prd.md` -> `design.md if present` -> `implement.md if present`.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress' when
     codex.dispatch_mode=inline. Codex-only opt-in alternate to

[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]
Flow: `trellis-before-dev` -> edit -> `trellis-check` -> validation -> `trellis-update-spec` -> Git authorization check (Phase 3.4) -> `/trellis:finish-work`.
Native checks cover the actual task scope and report Spec and Standards separately; use task-selected verification. Check success does not grant Git authorization.

Do not dispatch implement/check sub-agents in inline mode.
Read context: `prd.md` -> `design.md if present` -> `implement.md if present`, plus relevant spec/research loaded by skills.
[/workflow-state:in_progress-inline]

### Phase 3: Finish
- 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`
- 3.3 Spec update `[required · once]`
- 3.4 Check Git authorization `[required · once]`
- 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

> Note: step 3.1 was folded into 2.2 (last-iteration full-scope check) and 3.4 (commit preamble). Numbering kept stable to avoid breaking external references.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='completed'.
     Currently DEAD in normal flow: cmd_archive writes status='completed' in
     the same call that moves the task dir to archive/, so the active-task
     resolver loses the pointer and the hook never fires on archived tasks.
     Block preserved for a future status-transition redesign (e.g. an
     explicit in_progress→completed command). Edit through the same spec
     channel as the live blocks. -->

[workflow-state:completed]
Verify actual acceptance and Git state. Use the native finish-work entrypoint only within archive/journal authorization; preserve unrelated dirty work and keep pending Git actions explicit.
[/workflow-state:completed]

### Rules

1. Identify which Phase you're in, then continue from the next step there
2. Run steps in order inside each Phase; `[required]` steps can't be skipped
3. Phases can roll back (e.g., Execute reveals a prd defect → return to Plan to fix, then re-enter Execute)
4. Steps tagged `[once]` are skipped if the output already exists; don't re-run
5. Artifact presence informs the next step; missing `design.md` / `implement.md` is valid for lightweight tasks and incomplete planning for complex tasks.

### Active Task Routing

When a user request matches one of these intents inside an active task, route first, then load the detailed phase step if needed.

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

- Unresolved user decisions -> automatically select task-bound `grill-with-docs` under Phase 1.1; reuse the current interview owner and confirmed answers, with native brainstorm as fallback. Clear requests proceed without interviewing. Implementation-discovered requirement gaps return to planning for the affected scope.
- `in_progress` implementation/check -> dispatch `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.
- Completed-work retrospective -> `retro`; repeated-debugging retrospective -> native `trellis-break-loop`, which reuses `retro` or its bounded fallback. Active diagnosis keeps its diagnostic owner. Spec updates -> `trellis-update-spec`.

### Guardrails

- Creation-only approval is not implementation approval; reuse existing explicit implementation approval after artifact review, then use `task.py start`.
- PRD-only is valid for lightweight tasks; complex tasks need `design.md` + `implement.md`.
- Planning must be persisted to task artifacts; checks must run before reporting completion.

### Loading Step Detail

At each step, run this to fetch detailed guidance:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <step>
# e.g. python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step 1.1
```

---

## Phase 1: Plan

Goal: classify the request, resolve existing task authorization when a task is needed, and produce the planning artifacts required before implementation.

#### 1.0 Create task `[required · once]`

Create the task directory after resolving authorization under Request Triage; an explicitly requested lightweight implementation needs no separate creation approval. The command sets status to `planning`, writes `task.json`, creates a default `prd.md`, and auto-targets the new task when session identity is available:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<task title>" --slug <name>
```

`--slug` is the human-readable name only. Do **not** include the `MM-DD-` date prefix; `task.py create` adds that prefix automatically.

For task trees, create the parent task first and draft each child with `--parent <parent-dir> --no-start` so the parent retains this session's planning context. Do not start the parent just because children exist; start the authorized child owning the next independently verifiable deliverable after its planning gate.

After this command succeeds, the per-turn breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:planning]`, telling the AI to stay in planning.

Run only `create` here — do not also run `start`. `start` flips status to `in_progress`, which switches the breadcrumb to the implementation phase before planning artifacts are reviewed. Save `start` for step 1.4.

Skip when `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source` already points to a task.

#### 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]`

Inspect current task artifacts, relevant specifications, and repository facts first. Automatically select task-bound `grill-with-docs`, without requiring the user to name it, when a user decision affecting scope, key design choices, or acceptance criteria remains unresolved. Use the selected skill's automatic-selection guidance for detailed boundaries. Resolve factual questions from evidence and routine implementation choices with engineering judgment; clear or already-confirmed requests proceed directly. Complexity alone does not trigger an interview.

Reuse an ongoing interview owner and confirmed answers. If `grill-with-docs` is unavailable, use equivalent native `trellis-brainstorm`; use one interview path for the same choices. Explicit `grill-me` remains stateless, and Trellis persists its confirmed conclusions afterward without another interview. Reopen only choices affected by new evidence or changed requirements.

If implementation reveals a requirement gap, return to this step for the affected scope. Record research/prototype evidence needed for dependent questions and continue independent authorized work. Capture confirmed answers in the current PRD/design/plan, then resume dependent implementation only after the native planning gate is satisfied. Interview completion alone grants no task-state, implementation, Git, or installation permission.

`to-spec`, `to-tickets`, and `wayfinder` provide synthesis, native outcome slicing, and decision mapping within this phase, using the same PRD/Design/Plan and native task commands.

The brainstorm skill will guide you to:
- Ask one question at a time
- Ask only unresolved user choices whose prerequisite decisions are settled; mark research/prototype-dependent branches with the evidence needed
- Prefer researching over asking the user
- Prefer offering options over open-ended questions
- Update `prd.md` immediately after each user answer
- Split large scopes into a parent task plus child tasks when the deliverables can be verified independently
- Keep `prd.md` focused on requirements and acceptance criteria
- For complex tasks, produce `design.md` and `implement.md` before implementation starts

Reuse project domain vocabulary. Persist resolved terms in the existing domain location and only durable, surprising, hard-to-reverse trade-offs in the existing decision location. Keep task-specific choices in `design.md`; create entries when needed rather than a second glossary/ADR tree.

When considering a parent/child split:
- Use a parent task when one request contains several independently verifiable deliverables.
- Parent tasks own source requirements, child-task mapping, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review.
- Child tasks own actual deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently.
- Parent/child structure is not a dependency system. If child B depends on child A, write that ordering in child B's `prd.md` / `implement.md`.
- Start the child task that owns the next deliverable. Do not start the parent unless the parent itself has direct implementation work.

Return to this step whenever requirements change and revise the relevant artifact.

#### 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`

Research can happen at any time during requirement exploration. It isn't limited to local code — you can use any available tool (MCP servers, skills, web search, etc.) to look up external information, including third-party library docs, industry practices, API references, etc.

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

Spawn the research sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-research`
- **Task description**: Research <specific question>
- **Key requirement**: Research output MUST be persisted to `{TASK_DIR}/research/`

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

Do the research in the main session directly and write findings into `{TASK_DIR}/research/`. (For `codex-inline` this avoids the `fork_turns="none"` isolation that prevents `trellis-research` sub-agents from resolving the active task path.)

[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

**Research artifact conventions**:
- One file per research topic (e.g. `research/auth-library-comparison.md`)
- Record third-party library usage examples, API references, version constraints in files
- Note relevant spec file paths you discovered for later reference

Brainstorm and research can interleave freely — pause to research a technical question, then return to talk with the user.

**Key principle**: Research output must be written to files, not left only in the chat. Conversations get compacted; files don't.

#### 1.3 Configure context `[required · once]`

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

Curate `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` so the Phase 2 sub-agents get the right spec/research context. These files were seeded on `task create` with a single self-describing `_example` line; your job here is to fill in real entries.

**Location**: `{TASK_DIR}/implement.jsonl` and `{TASK_DIR}/check.jsonl` (already exist).

**Format**: one JSON object per line — `{"file": "<path>", "reason": "<why>"}`. Paths are repo-root relative.

**What to put in**:
- **Spec files** — `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` and any specific guideline files (`error-handling.md`, `conventions.md`, etc.) relevant to this task
- **Research files** — `{TASK_DIR}/research/*.md` that the sub-agent will need to consult

**What NOT to put in**:
- Code files (`src/**`, `packages/**/*.ts`, etc.) — those are read by the sub-agent during implementation, not pre-registered here
- Files you're about to modify — same reason

**Split between the two files**:
- `implement.jsonl` → specs + research the implement sub-agent needs to write code correctly
- `check.jsonl` → specs for the check sub-agent (quality guidelines, check conventions, same research if needed)

These manifests do not replace `implement.md`. `implement.md` is the human-readable execution plan for a complex task; jsonl files only list context files to inject or load.

**How to discover relevant specs**:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages
```

Lists every package + its spec layers with paths. Pick the entries that match this task's domain.

**How to append entries**:

Either edit the jsonl file directly in your editor, or use:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" implement "<path>" "<reason>"
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" check "<path>" "<reason>"
```

Delete the seed `_example` line once real entries exist (optional — it's skipped automatically by consumers).

Ready gate: both `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must contain at least one real `{"file": "...", "reason": "..."}` entry before `task.py start`. The seed `_example` row alone is not ready.

Skip this step only when both files already have real curated entries.

Skip this step. Context is loaded directly by the `trellis-before-dev` skill in Phase 2.

#### 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]`

After artifact review, flip the task status to `in_progress`:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <task-dir>
```

For lightweight tasks, `prd.md` can be enough. For complex tasks, `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` must exist and be reviewed before start. On sub-agent-dispatch platforms, `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must both have real curated entries before start. Runtime consumers tolerate missing or seed-only manifests for compatibility, but that tolerance is not a planning-ready state.

After this command succeeds, the breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:in_progress]`, and the rest of Phase 2 / 3 follows.

If `task.py start` errors with a session-identity message (no context key from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or platform-native session env), follow the hint in the error to set up session identity, then retry.

#### 1.5 Completion criteria

| Condition | Required |
|------|:---:|
| `prd.md` exists | ✅ |
| Existing explicit implementation authorization covers the reviewed scope; outstanding decisions resolved | ✅ |
| `task.py start` has been run (status = in_progress) | ✅ |
| `research/` has artifacts (complex tasks) | recommended |
| `design.md` exists (complex tasks) | ✅ |
| `implement.md` exists (complex tasks) | ✅ |

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

| `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` each contain at least one real curated entry (seed row does not count) | ✅ |

## Phase 2: Execute

Goal: turn reviewed planning artifacts into code that passes quality checks.

#### 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, CodeBuddy, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running the task-selected checks required by applicable specs
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: Tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The platform hook/plugin auto-handles:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects referenced spec/research files into the agent prompt
- Injects `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, CodeBuddy, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi]

[codex-sub-agent, Gemini, Qoder, Copilot, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running the task-selected checks required by applicable specs
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then explicitly say the spawned agent is already `trellis-implement` and must implement directly without spawning another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The pull-based sub-agent definition auto-handles the context load requirement:
- Resolves the active task with `task.py current --source`, then reads `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and requires the agent to load each referenced spec/research file before coding

[/codex-sub-agent, Gemini, Qoder, Copilot, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

[Kiro]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running the task-selected checks required by applicable specs
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: Tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The platform prelude auto-handles the context load requirement:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects referenced spec/research files into the agent prompt
- Injects `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present

[/Kiro]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

1. Load the `trellis-before-dev` skill to read project guidelines
2. Read `{TASK_DIR}/prd.md`, then `design.md` if present, then `implement.md` if present
3. Consult materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`
4. Implement the code per reviewed artifacts
5. Run the task-selected checks required by applicable specs

[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

#### 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`

One native check covers two dimensions: **Spec** (PRD acceptance, correctness, scope, and design/contracts) and **Standards** (applicable project conventions and maintainability). Report each separately with evidence. Establish the actual task scope, including task-owned earlier commits, staged/unstaged changes, and new files; exclude unrelated work. Execute task-selected checks at the smallest sufficient scope and record actual results and uncovered boundaries. Parallel reviewers are not required by these dimensions.

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

Spawn the check sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-check`
- **Task description**: Review the verified task scope against specs and task artifacts; report Spec and Standards separately. Fix task-caused findings only within authorized implementation scope; read-only review reports findings. Run task-selected checks and record coverage.
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: Tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-check` sub-agent and must perform the assigned review and any authorized fixes directly, not spawn another `trellis-check` / `trellis-implement`.

The check agent's job:
- Review code changes against specs
- Review code changes against `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- Fix task-caused issues only within authorized implementation scope; report unrelated or read-only findings
- Run the selected checks proportionate to the task and record actual results

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Reasonix, Trae]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

Load the `trellis-check` skill and verify the code per its guidance:
- Spec compliance
- lint / type-check / tests
- Cross-layer consistency (when changes span layers)

If implementation fixes are authorized, repair task-caused issues and rerun affected checks. For read-only review, report findings; unrelated failures remain outside scope.

[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

**Final pass (before completion or an authorized commit)**: review the entire task scope, including earlier task commits and new files, rather than only the latest chunk. Use `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages` to identify affected packages and read their relevant Quality Check sections. Run the smallest selected checks that cover the task's risks; task-wide review does not mean a full-repository test run. Reuse still-valid evidence.

#### 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

- `check` reveals a prd defect → return to Phase 1, fix `prd.md`, then redo 2.1
- Implementation went wrong → correct task-caused changes under existing authorization; preserve unrelated edits and obtain authorization before destructive rollback
- Need more research → research (same as Phase 1.2), write findings into `research/`

---

## Phase 3: Finish

Goal: ensure code quality, capture lessons, record the work.

#### 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`

For a requested retrospective of completed work, use `retro`. For repeated debugging, use the native `trellis-break-loop` entrypoint, which performs the same analysis through `retro` when available and a bounded local fallback otherwise. Keep one retrospective owner and reuse existing evidence.

Capture supported causes, why earlier attempts failed, useful practices and the smallest prevention recommendations. Retrospective analysis does not rerun work, implement fixes, create tasks or grant Git/task-state authority. Write to existing records only within the request or current task's documentation authorization.

#### 3.3 Spec update `[required · once]`

Load the `trellis-update-spec` skill and review whether this task produced new knowledge worth recording:
- Newly discovered patterns or conventions
- Pitfalls you hit
- New technical decisions

Promote only durable confirmed lessons to existing `.trellis/spec/` documents within current authorization; task-specific results remain in the task record. Record "no durable spec change" when appropriate. A read-only review or stateless Grill does not grant document writes.

#### 3.4 Check Git authorization `[required · once]`

**Spec-sync preamble**: before drafting commits, ask: did this task fix a bug or surface non-obvious knowledge that should land in `.trellis/spec/` so future-you (or future-AI) doesn't repeat the mistake? If yes, return to Phase 3.3 first — spec writes belong in the same task's commit batch, not as a forgotten follow-up.

This step checks the Git authorization boundary; it does not make committing mandatory. When the user has not authorized a commit, report verified work and pending Git state, then continue the permitted wrap-up. A finish/archive request alone does not grant Git permission.

When commit authorization exists:

1. Inspect `git status --short`, staged/unstaged changes, task-owned new files and recent history. Preserve unrelated work and existing staging.
2. Establish the task's exact file/hunk allowlist and a suitable commit message. Reuse the user's existing authorization when it covers this concrete scope; ask only if inclusion, history changes or another material choice remains unresolved.
3. Stage and commit only the allowed changes. Verify the resulting commit and remaining worktree state. Do not amend or rewrite history unless separately authorized.
4. Push only when explicitly authorized, verify the configured remote/branch and report the actual remote result. An authorized commit alone does not authorize pushing.

Archive and journal scripts can auto-commit by default. Callers must pass `--no-commit` unless existing Git authorization covers the exact resulting changes; using the flag and then a scoped Git procedure preserves unrelated task/workspace work. If those records are also authorized for commit, include them through the same scoped Git procedure; there is no mandatory number or sequence of commits.

#### 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

Record the next action, unresolved blockers, and actual verification scope/results in the current task or journal. Reference canonical PRD/design/implementation/research files instead of a second handoff specification. Native continue resumes from task status and artifacts, reuses valid evidence, and does not grant implementation or Git authorization.

Report completion and pending actions. If archive/journal work remains, point to the available native finish-work entrypoint; do not assume a command spelling or execute it without matching authorization.

## Customizing Trellis (for forks)

This section is for developers who want to modify the Trellis workflow itself. All customization is done by editing this file; the scripts are parsers only.

### Changing what a step means

Edit the corresponding step's walkthrough body in the Phase 1 / 2 / 3 sections above. Critical invariants:
- No active task must triage first, skip tasks for consultation, and reuse explicit implementation authorization for lightweight work.
- Planning must distinguish lightweight PRD-only tasks from complex tasks that require `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before start.
- Every required execution path must keep the Phase 3.4 commit reminder reachable before `/trellis:finish-work`.

All tag blocks live in the `## Phase Index` section above, immediately after each phase summary:

| Scope | Corresponding tag |
|---|---|
| No active task (before Phase 1) | `[workflow-state:no_task]` (after the Phase Index ASCII art) |
| All of Phase 1 (task created → ready for implementation) | `[workflow-state:planning]` (after Phase 1 summary) |
| Codex inline Phase 1 | `[workflow-state:planning-inline]` |
| Phase 2 + Phase 3.2–3.4 (implementation + check + wrap-up) | `[workflow-state:in_progress]` (after Phase 2 summary) |
| Codex inline Phase 2 + Phase 3.2–3.4 | `[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]` |
| After Phase 3.5 (archived) | `[workflow-state:completed]` (after Phase 3 summary; **currently DEAD**) |

### Changing the per-turn prompt text

Directly edit the body of the corresponding `[workflow-state:STATUS]` block. After editing, run `trellis update` (if you're a template maintainer) or restart your AI session (if you're customizing your own project) — no script changes required.

### Adding a custom status

Add a new block:

```
[workflow-state:my-status]
your per-turn prompt text
[/workflow-state:my-status]
```

Constraints:
- STATUS charset: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` (underscores and hyphens allowed, e.g. `in-review`, `blocked-by-team`)
- A lifecycle hook must write `task.json.status` to your custom value, otherwise the tag is never read
- Lifecycle hooks live in `task.json.hooks.after_*` and bind to one of `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`

### Adding a lifecycle hook

Add a `hooks` field to your `task.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "after_finish": [
      "your-script-or-command-here"
    ]
  }
}
```

Supported events: `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`. Note that `after_finish` ≠ a status change (it only clears the active-task pointer); use `after_archive` for "task is done" notifications.

### Full contract

For the workflow state machine's runtime contract, the locations of all status writers, pseudo-statuses (`no_task` / `stale_<source_type>`), the hook reachability matrix, and other deep details, see:

- `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/workflow-state-contract.md` — runtime contract + writer table + test invariants
- `.trellis/scripts/inject-workflow-state.py` — actual parser (reads workflow.md only, no embedded text)
